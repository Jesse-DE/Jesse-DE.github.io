						<h2>Who I am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Esaie is currently a PhD researcher in Computer Science/Data Science at Quantum Leap Africa of the African Institute 
						for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), and affiliated to the University of Rwanda. His research focuses on the use of high-resolution satellite imagery, spatial data, 
						and machine learning techniques to study socio-economic inequalities and their implications on health in urban settings. He holds a Master of Science in 
						Geo-information science and Earth Observation from the University of Twente, the Netherlands.</p>
					
					<p>His research interests include Spatial Data Science, Machine Learning, Earth Observation, Geo-information science, Software and Application Development,
						urban analytics, environment, land and urban systems, and Health.</p> 
					
					<p>Esaie possesses extensive experience across both industry and academia, specializing in geospatial technologies and machine learning for Earth observation. 
						He served as a Machine Learning for Earth Observation Consultant with GFA Consulting Group GmbH, where he played a key role in designing and 
						implementing a curriculum aimed at training data scientists in Rwanda. As a Lecturer at INES-Ruhengeri and a Visiting Lecturer at ICK, he taught courses 
						including Remote Sensing, GIS, Cadastral Surveying, Land Reform and Development, and Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). Additionally, 
						as a Global Forest Watch Technology Fellow with the World Resources Institute, he developed a forest monitoring application for the Nile-Congo ridge 
						area of Rwanda, leveraging Earth observation data. His involvement with non-profit organizations has seen him work as an Environmentalist, GIS 
						professional, and Regional Ambassador, emphasizing his commitment to environmental sustainability and geospatial innovation.</p>

						<h2>My research</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Urban poverty has increased in many cities, especially in the Global South, making effective urban governance crucial 
						for socio-economic development, reducing inequality, and building just cities with improved public health. However, 
						necessary information is often missing, as is the case in Rwanda. This research leverages big data to map and analyze 
						urban socio-economic development and its implications on health in Kigali at the granular spatial scale of neighborhoods 
						by combining satellite images, mobile phone data, and data related to the built environment and access to services. 
						Through effective geospatial visualization, the research translates academic analyses into practical insights to support 
						urban governance, urban management, urban public health, decision-making, and defining priority areas for urban socio-economic 
						transformation to achieve equitable, spatially just cities with improved health outcomes.</p>
