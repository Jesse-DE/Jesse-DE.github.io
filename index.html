							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Esaie is currently a PhD researcher in Computer Science/Data Science at Quantum Leap Africa at the African Institute 
							for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), 
							and affiliated to the University of Rwanda. His research is focusing on the use of high-resolution satellite imagery, spatial data 
							and machine learning techniques to study socio-economic inequalities and their implications on health in urban 
							settings. He holds a Master of Science in Geo-information science and Earth Observation from the University of Twente, 
							the Netherlands.

						<p>His research interests focus on understanding the interaction between people and their living environment and include 
							Spatial Data Science, Machine Learning, Earth Observation, Geo-information science, urban analytics, environment, land 
							and urban systems, and Health.</p> 
						<p>He has extensive experience working with both industry and academia.
							He has worked as an Assistant Lecturer at INES-Ruhengeri, where he taught courses related to geospatial
							 technologies, including Remote Sensing, GIS, Cadastral Surveying, Land Reform and Development and SDI. He has also worked 
							 as a Global Forest Watch Technology Fellow with the World Resources Institutes, where he developed forest monitoring 
							 application for the Nile-Congo ridge area of Rwanda using Earth Observation data. He has been involved with non-profit 
							 organization as an Environmentalist and GIS professional, and Regional Ambassador.</p>

							<h2>My research</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Urban poor have increased in many cities, especially in the Global South. This makes effective urban governance
							even more urgent to help achieve socio-economic development, reduce inequality and build just cities
							with improved public health. Detailed information is necessary to support this through policy and decision making.
							However, it is missing. Like other Global South countries, Rwanda is facing lack of necessary information,
							making it hard to truly understand issues of socio-economic inequality and equity, and their implications on
							public health in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. This research leverages the potential of big data to map and
							analyse urban socio-economic development and its implication on health in Kigali at the granular spatial
							scale of the neighbourhood by combining satellite images, mobile phone data, and data related to the built
							environment and access to services. Thus, through effective geospatial visualization, the research will translate
							academic analyses into practical insights to support urban governance, urban management, urban public
							health, decision-making and defining the priority areas for urban socio-economic transformation to achieve
							equitable, spatially just cities and improved health.</p>
